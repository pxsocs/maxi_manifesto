WHAT IS BITCOIN MAXIMALISM?
Bitcoin maximalism is a belief amongst cryptocurrency advocates that Bitcoin is the only true digital asset, now or in the future, and that all other coins are inferior, distractions, or scams. Bitcoin maximalists think that Bitcoin should remain solely a digital asset, and not become an ecosystem enabling blockchain applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Smell the conflict of interest. Always question the incentives. Why is someone doing something? What is their motivation? Are they conflicted?
