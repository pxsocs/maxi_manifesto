Bitcoin Maximalists advocate that Bitcoin is and always will be the only true digital asset. All other assets are inferior distractions; most are scams that eventually will fade away.

Their understanding is based on observation and experience leading to some fundamental principals.

### Never Trust. Always Verify.

At the core of the digital asset revolution is the belief that one should never trust but rather verify the information. All code should be, by definition, open source or you are required to trust a third party.

> Trusted Third Parties are Security Holes
> -- <cite>[Nick Szabo, 2001][1]</cite>

Bitcoin [Code is open source][7] and can be verified by anyone. For example, it is very easy to verify the 21mm [maximum amount of issuance.][8].



### In a world of Open Source Code, every good idea can be copied. Bad ideas can be avoided.

Every


### Security and Reliability should come first

To become the world's global reserve this is paramount.
With great power comes great responsibility. Bitcoin cannot be running after every new innovation and trying to replicate the new shiny thing. The risks far outweight the potential rewards. This is a feature, not a bug.


### Genesis happens once. And only once.

Immaculate conception.


### Bad money drives out good

Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that "bad money drives out good." It is primarily used for consideration and application in currency markets. Gresham's law was originally based on the composition of minted coins and the value of the precious metals used in them.


### Lessons from the past

Include Willy Woo chart showing where alts go


### Incentives

Smell the conflict of interest. Always question the incentives. Why is someone doing something? What is their motivation? Are they conflicted?


### Custody Maximalism: your assets should be visible at the blockchain.

<strong>Only leave in Exchanges what you are willing to lose.
It is critical that you store your Bitcoins in your own wallets and hold your keys.</strong>

Exchanges are closed source. Several layers of trust are required:

- Trust that they are not lending your assets to others (fractional reserve);
- Trust that they are not committing fraud. Examples: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried;
- Trust that they have good governance around key management (who can sign transactions, cold vs hot wallets, etc.). Examples: [QuadrigaCx][3];
- Trust that their technology is resilient against hackers (exchanges are massive honey pots). Example: Mt. Gox;
- Trust that they will not be captured by their local Governments. Examples: [China closing exhanges like Huobi][4];
- Trust that they will not leak your personal information. Examples: [several here][5];
- Trust that they will continue to be able to run their business and won't shut down withdraws (business risk). Examples: [BlockFi][6].
